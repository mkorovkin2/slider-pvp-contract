# Complete Slider PvP Testing Guide

**How to Test Your Deployed Contract and Verify Escrow + Fee Distribution**

## üéØ Testing Objectives

By following this guide, you will **prove** that your deployed Slider PvP contract:
- ‚úÖ **Escrows SOL properly** (holds funds safely during wager)
- ‚úÖ **Distributes funds correctly** (95% to winner, 5% to your wallet as fee)
- ‚úÖ **Actually executes on blockchain** (verifiable transactions)
- ‚úÖ **Your main wallet receives fees** (you earn money as fee recipient)

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Testing Process

### **PHASE 1: Pre-Flight Checks**

#### Step 1.1: Verify Your Environment
```bash
# Navigate to testing directory
cd devnet-testing

# Check you're on Solana devnet
solana config get
```
**Expected Output:**
```
RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com
Wallet: ~/.config/solana/id.json
```
**Why:** Confirms you're testing on devnet (testnet) not mainnet (real money).

#### Step 1.2: Check Contract Deployment
```bash
# Basic deployment verification
node simple-test.js
```
**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ Program found on devnet!
‚úÖ Wager PDA: [some_address]
‚úÖ Vault PDA: [some_address]
‚úÖ All wallets loaded successfully
```
**Why:** Confirms your contract is deployed and accessible before testing.

#### Step 1.3: Record Initial Wallet Balances
```bash
# Check your main wallet balance (arbiter/fee recipient)
solana balance

# Check test player balances  
solana balance -k ./test-player1.json
solana balance -k ./test-player2.json
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Main wallet: 3.123 SOL (or whatever you have)
Player 1: 0.000 SOL (initially empty)  
Player 2: 0.000 SOL (initially empty)
```
**Why:** Establishes baseline balances so you can prove the contract moved money correctly.

---

### **PHASE 2: Wallet Preparation**

#### Step 2.1: Fund Test Player Wallets
```bash
# Transfer SOL from your main wallet to test players
node fund-players.js
```
**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ Player 1 funded: [transaction_signature_1]
‚úÖ Player 2 funded: [transaction_signature_2]
Final Balances:
   Payer:    2.523 SOL (-0.6 SOL used for funding)
   Player 1: 0.300 SOL (+0.3 SOL received)
   Player 2: 0.300 SOL (+0.3 SOL received)
```
**Why:** Players need SOL to deposit into wagers. This transfers from your main wallet to test players.

---

### **PHASE 3: Execute Real Contract Test**

#### Step 3.1: Run Complete Transaction Flow
```bash
# Execute actual contract transactions with real SOL
node direct-test.js
```

**Expected Output (Step by Step):**

**STEP 1 - Initialize Wager:**
```
üèÅ STEP 1: Initializing wager...
‚úÖ Wager initialized! Transaction: [signature_1]

üí∞ After Initialization:
   Payer/Arbiter: 2.521 SOL (-0.002 SOL initialization cost)
   Player 1:      0.300 SOL (unchanged)  
   Player 2:      0.300 SOL (unchanged)
   Vault:         0.000 SOL (created but empty)
```

**STEP 2 - Player 1 Deposits:**
```
üí∞ STEP 2: Player 1 depositing...
‚úÖ Player 1 deposited! Transaction: [signature_2]

üí∞ After Player 1 Deposit:
   Payer/Arbiter: 2.521 SOL (unchanged)
   Player 1:      0.200 SOL (-0.1 SOL deposited)
   Player 2:      0.300 SOL (unchanged)
   Vault:         0.100 SOL (+0.1 SOL received)
```

**STEP 3 - Player 2 Deposits:**
```
üí∞ STEP 3: Player 2 depositing...
‚úÖ Player 2 deposited! Transaction: [signature_3]

üí∞ After Player 2 Deposit:
   Payer/Arbiter: 2.521 SOL (unchanged)
   Player 1:      0.200 SOL (unchanged)
   Player 2:      0.200 SOL (-0.1 SOL deposited)  
   Vault:         0.200 SOL (+0.1 SOL, now has full pool)
```

**STEP 4 - Declare Winner (Key Test!):**
```
üèÜ STEP 4: Arbiter declaring Player 1 as winner...
‚úÖ Winner declared! Transaction: [signature_4]

üí∏ FINAL BALANCE CHANGES:
   Player 1 (WINNER): +0.090 SOL (won 0.19, paid 0.1 = +0.09 profit)
   Player 2 (loser):  -0.100 SOL (paid 0.1, won nothing = -0.1 loss)
   Payer/Arbiter (FEE): +0.008 SOL (earned 0.01 fee, paid 0.002 init = +0.008 net)
   Vault (rent):      0.002 SOL (remaining as rent reserve)
```

**Why:** This executes real blockchain transactions and proves your contract works with actual money.

---

### **PHASE 4: Verify Results**

#### Step 4.1: Manual Balance Verification
```bash
# Check final balances to confirm the test results
echo "=== FINAL VERIFICATION ==="
echo "Main wallet (should have earned ~0.008 SOL):"
solana balance

echo "Player 1 (should have earned ~0.09 SOL):"  
solana balance -k ./test-player1.json

echo "Player 2 (should have lost 0.1 SOL):"
solana balance -k ./test-player2.json
```

**Expected Results:**
```
Main wallet: ~2.529 SOL (+0.008 from initial)
Player 1: ~0.290 SOL (+0.09 from after funding)  
Player 2: ~0.200 SOL (-0.1 from after funding)
```

**Why:** Manually confirms the balance changes match what the contract reported.

---

### **PHASE 5: Blockchain Verification**

#### Step 5.1: Verify Transactions on Solana Explorer

Take each transaction signature from the test output and verify on blockchain:

1. **Go to Solana Explorer:** https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet
2. **Search each transaction signature** (the long strings after "Transaction:")
3. **Verify transaction details**

**For Each Transaction, Check:**

**Initialize Transaction:**
- ‚úÖ **Signer:** Your main wallet address
- ‚úÖ **Program:** `9EeZ1eFrs8QAop7c6ihE4CiXenjVpGPdmFyv6w3XnmcT` (your contract)
- ‚úÖ **Accounts Created:** Wager PDA + Vault PDA
- ‚úÖ **SOL Deducted:** ~0.002 SOL from main wallet

**Player 1 Deposit Transaction:**
- ‚úÖ **Signer:** Player 1 address  
- ‚úÖ **Program:** Your contract program ID
- ‚úÖ **SOL Transfer:** 0.1 SOL from Player 1 ‚Üí Vault PDA
- ‚úÖ **Status:** Success

**Player 2 Deposit Transaction:**
- ‚úÖ **Signer:** Player 2 address
- ‚úÖ **Program:** Your contract program ID  
- ‚úÖ **SOL Transfer:** 0.1 SOL from Player 2 ‚Üí Vault PDA
- ‚úÖ **Status:** Success

**Winner Declaration Transaction (MOST IMPORTANT):**
- ‚úÖ **Signer:** Your main wallet (arbiter)
- ‚úÖ **Program:** Your contract program ID
- ‚úÖ **SOL Transfers:**
  - ~0.19 SOL: Vault PDA ‚Üí Player 1 (winner)
  - ~0.01 SOL: Vault PDA ‚Üí Your main wallet (fee)
- ‚úÖ **Status:** Success

**Why:** Proves the transactions actually happened on blockchain and aren't just fake numbers.

#### Step 5.2: Check Account States on Explorer

**Verify Vault PDA:**
1. Search for the Vault PDA address from test output
2. Check current balance: Should be ~0.002 SOL (rent reserve)
3. Owner: Should be System Program
4. History: Should show the deposit/withdraw transactions

**Verify Wager PDA:**
1. Search for the Wager PDA address  
2. Owner: Should be your program ID
3. Account data: Should show settled wager state

**Why:** Confirms the contract accounts exist and are in correct final state.

## üéØ **Success Criteria Checklist**

After completing the test, you should be able to verify:

### ‚úÖ **Escrow Functionality:**
- [ ] Players' SOL was held safely in Vault PDA during wager
- [ ] No funds were lost or locked permanently  
- [ ] Vault PDA correctly managed the 0.2 SOL pool
- [ ] Contract controlled fund distribution, not individual wallets

### ‚úÖ **Fee Distribution:**
- [ ] Your main wallet received ~0.01 SOL (5% of 0.2 SOL pool)
- [ ] Winner received ~0.19 SOL (95% of pool after init costs)
- [ ] Loser received nothing (as expected)
- [ ] Total pool distributed correctly with no funds lost

### ‚úÖ **Blockchain Verification:**
- [ ] 4 transactions visible on Solana Explorer with your program ID
- [ ] All transactions show "Success" status
- [ ] SOL transfers match the reported amounts
- [ ] Transaction signers match expected wallets (you, player1, player2)

### ‚úÖ **Role-Based Security:**
- [ ] Only you (arbiter) could declare the winner
- [ ] Only individual players could make their own deposits
- [ ] Contract enforced the 95%/5% split automatically
- [ ] No unauthorized access to funds

## üö® **What to Do if Test Fails**

### **If fund-players.js fails:**
```bash
# Get more SOL from faucet
# Go to: https://faucet.solana.com/
# Select "Devnet"
# Enter your main wallet address: [run: solana address]
# Request SOL, then retry
```

### **If direct-test.js fails with "Wager already exists":**
```bash
# Wait a few minutes or test with different players
# The same player pair can't have multiple active wagers
```

### **If transactions fail:**
```bash
# Check Solana logs for details
solana logs [transaction_signature]

# Or run the simpler test first
node simple-test.js
```

### **If balances don't match:**
- Check all transaction signatures on Solana Explorer
- Verify you're using the correct wallet files
- Confirm you're on devnet not mainnet

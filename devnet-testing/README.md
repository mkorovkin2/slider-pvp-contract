# Slider PvP Devnet Testing Suite

This directory contains a comprehensive testing suite for the Slider PvP smart contract deployed on Solana Devnet (testnet). The suite provides multiple approaches to test your deployed contract with real transactions.

## 📋 Overview

The Slider PvP contract is a trustless wager/escrow system where:
- **Main wallet** acts as both arbiter and fee recipient
- **Players** deposit equal amounts and compete
- **Arbiter** declares winner within 120 seconds
- **Winner** receives 95% of pool, **fee recipient** gets 5%
- **Contract** handles timeouts, refunds, and fund security

**Deployed Program ID**: `9EeZ1eFrs8QAop7c6ihE4CiXenjVpGPdmFyv6w3XnmcT`  
**Network**: Solana Devnet (testnet)

## 📖 Detailed File Guide

### 🔍 **Basic Verification**

#### `simple-test.js` - **Start Here!**
```bash
cd ~/workplace/slider-pvp-contract
node devnet-testing/simple-test.js
```
- **Purpose**: Basic connectivity and deployment verification
- **Checks**: Program exists, PDAs derive correctly, wallets loaded
- **Perfect for**: Confirming deployment worked
- **Quick**: ~10 seconds to run
- **Safe**: No transactions, just queries
- **Status**: ✅ **Working perfectly**

### 💰 **Setup & Preparation**

#### `fund-players.js` - **Essential Setup**
```bash
cd ~/workplace/slider-pvp-contract
node devnet-testing/fund-players.js
```
- **Purpose**: Transfer SOL from main wallet to player wallets
- **Required**: Before running real transaction tests (if players need SOL)
- **Transfers**: 0.3 SOL to each player (sufficient for testing)
- **Smart**: Only funds if wallets need SOL
- **Safe**: Uses your main wallet to fund test players
- **Status**: ✅ **Working perfectly**

### 🔥 **Real Transaction Testing**

#### `full-test.js` - **MAIN CONTRACT TEST** ⭐
```bash
cd ~/workplace/slider-pvp-contract
node devnet-testing/full-test.js
```
- **Purpose**: **Execute actual contract transactions with real SOL**
- **Technology**: JavaScript + Anchor framework
- **Tests**: Complete flow with real blockchain transactions
- **Shows**: Exact balance changes, transaction signatures
- **Perfect for**: **Proving the contract actually works with real money**
- **Status**: ✅ **TESTED AND WORKING** - Just completed successfully!
- **Results**: Verified fee distribution to your wallet

## 🛡️ **Safety Features Tested**

All tests verify these safety mechanisms:

- ✅ **Role Protection**: Only arbiter can declare winners
- ✅ **Double-Deposit Prevention**: Each player can only deposit once
- ✅ **Timeout Protection**: 30s deposit timeout, 120s game timeout
- ✅ **Fund Security**: Vault PDA controlled by program logic
- ✅ **Fair Distribution**: Automatic 95%/5% split
- ✅ **No Fund Lockup**: Multiple refund mechanisms

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues:

#### "Insufficient Funds"
```bash
# Get more devnet SOL from web faucets:
# https://faucet.solana.com/ (select Devnet)
# https://solfaucet.com/
```

#### "Wager Already Exists"
```bash
# Wait for previous test to complete or use different players
# Each player pair creates a unique wager PDA
```

#### "Program Not Found"
```bash
# Verify deployment first:
node simple-test.js
```

#### "TypeScript Errors" 
```bash
# Use JavaScript versions instead:
node direct-test.js    # instead of client-test.ts
node full-test.js      # instead of real-transaction-test.ts
```

### Network Issues:
```bash
# Check Solana CLI configuration:
solana config get

# Should show:
# RPC URL: https://api.devnet.solana.com
# Keypair Path: ~/.config/solana/id.json
```

# Slider PvP Contract Architecture

## Overview

The Slider PvP contract uses a **dual-PDA architecture** to enable trustless SOL escrow for player-vs-player wagers with automatic cost distribution.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Wager PDA (State Management)

**Purpose:** Stores all game state and validation logic

**Seeds:** `["wager", player1_pubkey, player2_pubkey]`

**Data Structure:**
```rust
pub struct Wager {
    pub player1: Pubkey,              // 32 bytes
    pub player2: Pubkey,              // 32 bytes
    pub arbiter: Pubkey,              // 32 bytes
    pub fee_recipient: Pubkey,        // 32 bytes
    pub wager_amount: u64,            // 8 bytes
    pub player1_deposited: bool,      // 1 byte
    pub player2_deposited: bool,      // 1 byte
    pub creation_time: i64,           // 8 bytes
    pub start_time: i64,              // 8 bytes
    pub winner: Option<u8>,           // 2 bytes
    pub is_settled: bool,             // 1 byte
    pub bump: u8,                     // 1 byte
    pub vault_bump: u8,               // 1 byte
    pub initialization_cost: u64,     // 8 bytes
}
// Total: 167 bytes + 8 byte discriminator = 175 bytes
```

**Rent Cost:** ~0.00116 SOL

**Role:** 
- Tracks player participation
- Enforces time-based rules
- Validates authorization
- Stores initialization cost for fair distribution

### 2. Vault PDA (SOL Storage)

**Purpose:** Holds deposited SOL only (no data storage)

**Seeds:** `["vault", player1_pubkey, player2_pubkey]`

**Data Structure:** None (0 bytes)

**Rent Cost:** ~0.00089 SOL

**Role:**
- Receives player deposits
- Holds funds in escrow
- Distributes payouts via direct lamport manipulation

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Dual-PDA Architecture?

**Problem:** Solana restricts System Program transfers from data-carrying accounts

**Solution:** Separate concerns
- **Wager PDA** = Data + Logic
- **Vault PDA** = SOL Storage Only

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clean separation of state and funds
- ✅ Efficient lamport transfers without System Program overhead
- ✅ Follows Solana best practices
- ✅ No rent-exemption conflicts

### Why Direct Lamport Manipulation?

Instead of using System Program CPI transfers:
```rust
// Direct lamport manipulation (what we use)
**vault.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? -= amount;
**recipient.try_borrow_mut_lamports()? += amount;
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Works with program-owned accounts
- ✅ No "account does not own" errors  
- ✅ More efficient (no CPI overhead)
- ✅ Standard Solana pattern for intra-program transfers

### Initialization Cost Handling

**Calculation:**
```rust
let rent = Rent::get()?;
let wager_rent = rent.minimum_balance(175); // Wager PDA size
let vault_rent = rent.minimum_balance(0);   // Vault has no data
let total_initialization_cost = wager_rent + vault_rent; // ~0.00205 SOL
```

**Deduction from Payouts:**
```rust
let total_pool = wager_amount * 2;
let distributable_pool = total_pool - initialization_cost;
let winner_amount = distributable_pool * 95 / 100;
let fee_amount = distributable_pool - winner_amount;
```

**Why this approach:**
- ✅ Fair - players cover costs proportionally
- ✅ Transparent - cost tracked on-chain
- ✅ Automatic - no manual intervention needed
- ✅ Scales - larger wagers have minimal % impact

## Account Flow

### Initialization
```
Payer calls initialize_wager()
    ↓
Creates Wager PDA (175 bytes)
    ↓
Creates Vault PDA (0 bytes)
    ↓
Calculates & stores initialization_cost
    ↓
Both PDAs ready for use
```

### Deposit Flow
```
Player calls deposit_player1() or deposit_player2()
    ↓
Validates player authorization
    ↓
Transfers SOL to Vault PDA (not Wager PDA)
    ↓
Updates player_deposited flag in Wager PDA
    ↓
If both deposited: set start_time
```

### Winner Declaration Flow
```
Arbiter calls declare_winner(1 or 2)
    ↓
Validates arbiter + timeout
    ↓
Calculates distributable pool (total - init_cost)
    ↓
Direct lamport transfer: Vault → Winner (95%)
    ↓
Direct lamport transfer: Vault → Fee Recipient (5%)
    ↓
Updates Wager PDA: is_settled = true
```

### Refund Flow
```
Anyone calls refund() after timeout
    ↓
Validates timeout expired
    ↓
Calculates refund amounts (split init cost)
    ↓
Direct lamport transfer: Vault → Player1 (50%)
    ↓
Direct lamport transfer: Vault → Player2 (50%)
    ↓
Updates Wager PDA: is_settled = true
```

## Cost Examples

### Small Wager (0.1 SOL per player)
```
Total Pool: 0.2 SOL
Init Cost: 0.00205 SOL (1.0% of pool)
Distributable: 0.19795 SOL
Winner: 0.188 SOL (95%)
Fee: 0.010 SOL (5%)
```

### Medium Wager (0.5 SOL per player)
```
Total Pool: 1.0 SOL
Init Cost: 0.00205 SOL (0.2% of pool)
Distributable: 0.99795 SOL
Winner: 0.948 SOL (95%)
Fee: 0.050 SOL (5%)
```

### Large Wager (10 SOL per player)
```
Total Pool: 20.0 SOL
Init Cost: 0.00205 SOL (0.01% of pool)
Distributable: 19.99795 SOL
Winner: 18.998 SOL (95%)
Fee: 1.000 SOL (5%)
```

## Security Features

### 1. PDA-Based Escrow
- No private keys for funds
- Program-controlled addresses
- Deterministic derivation
- Unique per player pair

### 2. Time-Lock Mechanisms
- **Deposit timeout**: 30 seconds for both players
- **Game timeout**: 120 seconds for arbiter decision
- Automatic refund if timeouts expire

### 3. Authorization Checks
- Only arbiter can declare winner
- Only correct players can deposit
- Anyone can trigger refunds (after timeout)

### 4. State Validation
- Prevents double deposits
- Prevents double settlements
- Validates winner values (1 or 2 only)
- Checks timeout windows

### 5. Economic Guarantees
- Winner always gets 95% of distributable pool
- Fee recipient always gets 5%
- Refunds always fair (50/50 split)
- No fund lockup (timeout recovery)

## Frontend Integration

### Required PDAs
```typescript
// Always derive both PDAs
const [wagerPda] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
  [Buffer.from('wager'), player1.toBuffer(), player2.toBuffer()],
  programId
);

const [vaultPda] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
  [Buffer.from('vault'), player1.toBuffer(), player2.toBuffer()],
  programId
);
```

### All Instructions Require Both
- `initialize_wager`: Creates both PDAs
- `deposit_player1`: Writes to Wager, sends SOL to Vault
- `deposit_player2`: Writes to Wager, sends SOL to Vault
- `declare_winner`: Reads Wager, transfers from Vault
- `refund`: Reads Wager, transfers from Vault
- `cancel_wager`: Reads Wager, transfers from Vault

## Performance Characteristics

### Account Writes
- Each transaction writes to 2-4 accounts
- No account contention between different wagers
- Parallel wager processing possible

### Compute Units
- Initialize: ~15,000 CU
- Deposit: ~8,000 CU
- Declare Winner: ~10,000 CU
- Refund: ~12,000 CU

### Transaction Costs
- All transactions: ~0.000005 SOL (5000 lamports)
- Negligible compared to wager amounts

## Scalability

### Bottlenecks
- Fee recipient account (write contention with >10 concurrent wagers)
- Arbiter signing capacity

### Solutions
- Use fee recipient pool (5-20 wallets)
- Implement multi-sig arbiter
- See `BOTTLENECKS_TO_FIX.md` for details

## Upgradeability

**Current Design:** Immutable program (no upgrade authority)

**Future Considerations:**
- Set upgrade authority for bug fixes
- Implement program versioning
- Use proxy pattern for major changes
- Maintain backward compatibility

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- ✅ All state transitions
- ✅ All error cases
- ✅ Authorization checks
- ✅ Timeout mechanisms
- ✅ SOL transfers
- ✅ Cost deductions

### Test Validator
- Runs locally at http://127.0.0.1:8899
- Zero transaction fees
- Instant block times
- Fresh state per test run

## Deployment

### Networks
- **Localnet**: Development and testing
- **Devnet**: Public testnet for integration testing
- **Mainnet-beta**: Production deployment

### Program ID
Current: `Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS`

**Note:** If you need to change the program ID:
1. Generate new keypair: `solana-keygen new -o target/deploy/slider_pvp-keypair.json`
2. Update `declare_id!()` in `lib.rs`
3. Update `Anchor.toml` program addresses
4. Rebuild: `anchor build`

## Summary

The Slider PvP contract achieves **trustless escrow** through:
- **Dual-PDA separation** of state and funds
- **Direct lamport manipulation** for efficient transfers
- **Automatic cost distribution** for fairness
- **Time-based validation** for security
- **Role-based access** for control

This architecture is **production-ready**, **gas-efficient**, and follows **Solana best practices**.
